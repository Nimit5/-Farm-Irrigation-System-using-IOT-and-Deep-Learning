# Farm-Irrigation-System-using-IOT-and-Deep-Learning
The farm irrigation system contains four sensor units such that each unit senses temperature and humidity values.
These values will be provided to a two-layer perception machine learning model with ReLu activation function to predict the water flow in percentage.
Implemented the forward pass in the Wokwi simulator.
